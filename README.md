# Mad Libs Game in Java ðŸŽ®

This is a simple **Mad Libs** game written in Java. It prompts the user to input various types of words (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) and uses them to fill in the blanks in a pre-defined story, resulting in a fun and often silly narrative.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter words such as:
   - Noun
   - Verb
   - Adjective
   - Place
   - Name, etc.

2. It inserts those words into a template story.

3. The final result is a unique, funny story each time you play.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8 or later)
- Console-based input using `Scanner`
